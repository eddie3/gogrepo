gogrepo
-------
Python-based tool for downloading your GOG.com game collections and extras to your local computer for full offline enjoyment.

It is a clean standalone python script that can be run from anywhere. It requires a typical Python 3 installation and html5lib.

By default, game folders are saved in the same location that the script is run in. You can also specify another
directory. Run gogrepo.py -h to see help or read more below. Each game has its own directories with all game/bonus files saved within.

Features
--------
* Ability to choose which games to download based on combinations of OS (windows, linux, mac) and language (en, fr, de, etc...)
* Saves a !info.txt in each game folder with information about each game/extra item.
* Creates a !serial.txt if the game has a special serial/cdkey (I know, not 100% DRM-free, is it?). Sometimes coupon codes are hidden here!
* Verify your downloaded collection with full MD5, zip integrity, and expected file size checking.
* Auto retrying of failed fetch/downloads. Sometime GOG servers report temporary errors.
* Check library for outdated installers and only keep most up-to-date versions
* Ability to import your already existing local collection.
* Easy to throw into a daily cronjob to get all the latest updates and newly added content!
* Clear logging prints showing update/download progress and HTTP errors. Easy to pipe or tee to create a log file.


Quick Start -- Typical Use Case
----------------

* Login to GOG and save your login cookie for later commands. Your login/pass can be specified or be prompted. You generally only need to do this once to create a valid gog-cookies.dat

* Download the games and bonus files for the OS and languages you want for all items known from the saved manifest file.

  ``gogrepo.py download``

* Verify and report integrity of all downloaded files. Does MD5, zip integrity, and expected filesize verification. This makes sure your game files can actually be read back and are healthy.

  ``gogrepo.py verify``
  
* Compare the downloaded installers and extras against the latest versions available from GOG.

  ``gogrepo.py removeold``
